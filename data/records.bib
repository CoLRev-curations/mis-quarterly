   abstract                      = {Members of an online community peer-produce digital artifacts by negotiating different perspectives and personal knowledge bases. These negotiations are manifested in the temporal evolution of the peer-produced artifact. In this study, we conceptualize the evolution of a digital artifact as a trajectory in a feature space. Our theoretical frame suggests that, through negotiations, contributors’ actions “pull” the trajectory and shape its movement in the feature space. We hypothesize that the type of contributors that work on a focal article influences the extent to which that article’s trajectory explores alternative positions within that space, and that the trajectory’s exploration is, in turn, associated with the artifact’s quality. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the trajectories of wiki articles drawn from two peer-production communities, Wikipedia and Wikia, tracking the evolution of 242 paired articles for over a decade during which the articles went through 536,745 revisions. We found that the contributors who are the most likely to increase the trajectory’s exploration are those that (1) return to work on the focal artifact and (2) are unregistered members in the broader online community. Further, our results show that the trajectory’s exploration has a curvilinear association with article quality, indicating that exploration contributes positively to quality, but that the effect is reversed when exploration exceeds a certain level. The insights derived from this study highlight the value of an artifact-centric approach to increasing our understanding of the dynamics underlying peer-production.},

   abstract                      = {Recent initiatives to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs have centered around payment mechanisms and IT-enabled health information exchanges (HIEs). Such initiatives profoundly influence both providers’ choices in terms of healthcare effort levels and HIE adoption and patients’ choice of providers. Using a game-theoretical model of a healthcare setup, we examine the role of payment models in aligning providers’ and patients’ incentives for realizing socially optimal (i.e., first-best) choices. We show that the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) payment model does not necessarily induce the first-best solution. The pay-for-performance (P4P) model may induce the first-best solution under some conditions if provider switching by patients during a health episode is socially suboptimal, making provider coordination less of an issue. We identify an episode-based payment (EBP) model that can always induce the first-best solution. The proposed EBP model reduces to the P4P model if the P4P model induces the first-best solution. In other cases, the first-best inducing EBP model is multilateral in the sense that the payment to a provider depends not only on the provider’s own efforts and outcomes but also on those of other providers. Furthermore, the payment in this EBP model is sequence dependent in the sense that payment to a provider is contingent upon whether the patient visits a given provider first or second. We show that the proposed EBP model achieves the lowest healthcare cost, not necessarily at the expense of care quality or provider payment, relative to FFS and P4P. Although our proposed contract is complex, it sets an optimality baseline when evaluating simpler contracts and also characterizes aspects of payment that need to be captured for socially desirable actions. We further show that the value of HIEs depends critically on the payment model as well as on the social desirability of patient switching. Under all three payment models, the HIE value is higher when switching by at least some patients is desirable than when switching by any patient is undesirable. Moreover, the HIE value is highest under the FFS model and lowest under the P4P model. Hence, assessing the value of HIEs in isolation from the underlying payment mechanism and patient-switching behavior may result in under- or overestimation of the HIE value. Therefore, as payment models evolve over time, there is a real need to reevaluate the HIE value and the government subsidies that induce providers to adopt HIEs.},

   abstract                      = {Firms’ investment in information technology (IT) has been widely considered to be a key enabler of innovation. In this study, we integrate prior findings on the augmenting pathways (where IT investment supports innovation) with a new theory explaining the suppressing pathways (where dynamic adjustment costs associated with large IT investment can be detrimental to innovation) to propose an overall inverted U-shaped relationship between IT investment and commercialized innovation performance (CIP). To test our theory, we analyze a unique panel dataset from the largest economy in Europe and discovered a curvilinear relationship between IT investment and CIP for firms across a broad spectrum of industries. Our research presents empirical evidence corroborating the augmenting and suppressing pathways linking IT investment and CIP. Our findings serve as a cautionary signal to executives, discouraging overinvestment in IT.},

Yet, measuring the quality of knowledge work is challenging, raising the question of how to evaluate AI performance in such contexts. We investigate this question through a field study of a major U.S. hospital, observing how managers evaluated five different machine-learning (ML) based AI tools. Each tool reported high performance according to standard AI accuracy measures, which were based on ground truth labels provided by qualified experts. Trying these tools out in practice, however, revealed that none of them met expectations. Searching for explanations, managers began confronting the high uncertainty of experts’ know-what knowledge captured in ground truth labels used to train and validate ML models. In practice, experts address this uncertainty by drawing on rich know-how practices, which were not incorporated into these ML-based tools. Discovering the disconnect between AI’s know-what and experts’ know-how enabled managers to better understand the risks and benefits of each tool. This study shows dangers of treating ground truth labels used in ML models objectively when the underlying knowledge is uncertain. We outline implications of our study for developing, training, and evaluating AI for knowledge work.},

   abstract                      = {Constructs and indicators are central to the efforts of many researchers who seek to build and test theories and articulate rich narratives about real-world phenomena. For this reason, an extensive discourse exists about their nature. Increasingly, this discourse has become fraught with controversy. Using Bunge’s (1977, 1979) ontology, I examine the nature of constructs and indicators as they are discussed in the extant literature. I define these concepts precisely, disentangle conceptual from measurement issues, and point to ways that discourse about them could better proceed. I show that unidimensional constructs, multidimensional constructs, dimensions, and indicators are all properties in general of a class of things. I also show that only three types of indicators exist—synonyms of the focal construct and succeeding or preceding properties in a pre-order of properties that includes the focal construct. I examine ontologically the notions of content validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and internal-consistency reliability and show their problematic nature. I introduce two new concepts, scope validity and the level of concomitance of indicators, that have rigorous ontological foundations. Together, they provide an improved foundation for assessing the construct validity of a set of indicators.},

   abstract                      = {We define a prescriptive analytics framework that addresses the needs of a constrained decision-maker facing, ex ante, unknown costs and benefits of multiple policy levers. The framework is general in nature and can be deployed in any utility-maximizing context, public or private. It relies on randomized field experiments for causal inference, machine learning for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, and on the optimization of an integer linear program for converting predictions into decisions. The net result is the discovery of individual-level targeting of policy interventions to maximize overall utility under a budget constraint. The framework is set in the context of the four pillars of analytics and is especially valuable for companies that already have an existing practice of running A/B tests. The key contribution of this work is to develop and operationalize a framework to exploit both within- and between-treatment arm heterogeneity in the utility response function in order to derive benefits from future (optimized) prescriptions. We demonstrate the value of this framework as compared to benchmark practices—i.e., the use of the average treatment effect, uplift modeling, as well as an extension to contextual bandits—in two different settings. Unlike these standard approaches, our framework is able to recognize, adapt to, and exploit the (potential) presence of different subpopulations that experience varying costs and benefits within a treatment arm while also exhibiting differential costs and benefits across treatment arms. As a result, we find a targeting strategy that produces an order of magnitude improvement in expected total utility for the case where significant within- and between-treatment arm heterogeneity exists.},

   abstract                      = {We review the literature on how organizations learn from information system (IS) incidents. We identify three modes of learning depending on the practices that constitute the learning process, the specific actors who play roles in learning, the temporal orientation of the learning practices, and the specific contextual focus of the learning. The literature focuses primarily on learning from past experience to draw lessons for future incidents (reflective learning mode). Yet, a growing stream of literature stresses the importance of learning through engagement with present incidents (embedded learning mode), and a few studies suggest that organizations can learn prospectively to prepare for future incidents (prospective learning mode). We argue that although these three learning modes are effective, they do not adequately explain how organizations learn from IS incidents when used in isolation. Since IS incidents unfold increasingly as sets of interacting events across information systems and organizational settings, organizational learning needs to be theorized as an iterative process among these learning modes. We synthesize these three learning modes into an integrative framework and theorize about their supportive and inhibiting relations. We suggest some opportunities for future research, which would advance our understanding of how organizations learn from IS incidents.},

   abstract                      = {We study the effect of peer influence on products that exhibit positive network externalities to non-adopters, i.e., products that benefit adopters’ friends even if they do not adopt. In contrast to products that exhibit positive network externalities upon adoption, this structure of incentives likely results in negative peer influence: the more friends that adopt the product, the smaller the incentive to adopt. We measure this effect empirically by using observational data from a large mobile carrier serving 5.7 million users. We estimate the effect of peer influence across five different products of this type. A naive approach to do this results in a positive estimate for peer influence due to unobserved homophily. We follow two approaches to address this issue. First, we suggest using the number of friends that end up adopting a product as a proxy for unobserved user-fixed effects. Second, we control for homophily by applying a shuffle test, i.e., we compare the effect of peer influence from the original data with the effect obtained from comparable randomly generated data without peer influence. We obtain negative estimates from both approaches, which adds robustness to our findings. Finally, we show that even for these products, the effect of peer influence associated with the first friends that adopt the product is positive because they still convey useful information that reduces uncertainty. The negative effect of peer influence arises only for subsequent friends that adopt the product. While these friends are unlikely to convey new information about the product, they decrease the economic incentive to adopt, resulting in a negative aggregate effect of peer influence.},

Yet despite the importance of knowing what it takes to use information systems effectively, little theory on the topic exists. One recent and largely untested exception is the theory of effective use (TEU). We report on a contextualization, extension, and test of TEU in the business intelligence (BI) context, a context of considerable importance in which researchers have called for such studies. We used a mixed methods, three-phase approach involving instrument development (n = 218), a two-wave cross-sectional survey (n = 437), and three sets of follow-up interviews (n = 33). The paper contributes by (1) showing how TEU can be contextualized, operationalized, and extended, (2) demonstrating that many of TEU’s predictions hold in the BI context while also revealing ways to improve the theory, and (3) offering practical insights that executives can draw on to improve the use of BI in their organizations.},

   abstract                      = {Despite increased empirical attention, theory on bots and how they act to disseminate information on social media remains poorly understood. Our study leverages the conduit brokerage perspective and the findings of a multiple case study to develop a novel framework of algorithmic conduit brokerage for understanding information dissemination by bots and the design choices that may influence their actions. Algorithmic conduit brokerage encompasses two intertwined processes. The first process, algorithmic social alertness, relies on bot activity to curate and reconfigure information. Algorithmic social alertness is significant because it involves action triggers that dictate the kinds of information being searched, discovered, and retrieved by bots. The second process, algorithmic social transmission, relies on bot activity to embellish and distribute the information curated. Algorithmic social transmission is important because it can broaden the reach of information disseminated by bots through increased discoverability and directed targeting. The two algorithmic conduit brokerage processes we offer are unique to bots and distinct from the original conceptualization of conduit brokerage, which is rooted in human activity. First, since bots lack the human ability of sensemaking and are instead fueled by automation and action triggers rather than by emotions, algorithmic conduit brokerage is more invariant and reliable than human conduit brokerage. Second, automation increases the speed and scale of information curation and transfer, making algorithmic conduit brokerage not only more consistent but also faster and more extensive. Third, algorithmic conduit brokerage includes a set of new concepts (e.g., action triggers and rapid scaling) that are specific to bots and therefore not applicable to human conduit brokerage.},

   abstract                      = {We have recently witnessed two important trends in online retailing: The advent of new media (e.g., social media and search engines) has made advertising affordable for small sellers, and large online retailers (e.g., Amazon and JD.com) have opened their platforms to allow even direct competitors to sell on their platforms. We examine how new-media advertising affects retail platform openness. We develop a game-theoretic model in which a leading retailer, who has both valuation and awareness advantages, and a third-party seller, who sells an identical product, engage in price competition. We find that the availability of relatively low-cost advertising through new media plays a critical role in influencing the leading retailer to open its platform and to form a partnership with the third-party seller, which is impossible when the cost of advertising is relatively high. Low-cost advertising can increase consumer surplus either directly via the third-party seller’s advertising or indirectly via the partnership on the leading retailer’s platform. We also find that the leading retailer has a greater incentive to open its platform and that the partnership is more likely to be formed when there are network effects, when the leading retailer can control the third-party seller’s exposure on its platform, or when the leading retailer can offer a direct advertising service to the third-party seller. Meanwhile, the constraint on the third-party seller’s advertising budget can reduce the leading retailer’s incentive to open its platform, making a partnership less likely. Our analysis offers important insights into the underlying economic incentives that help explain the emerging open retail platform trend in the era of new-media advertising.},

   abstract                      = {Online crowdfunding holds the promise of empowering entrepreneurs and small businesses as an innovative alternative financing channel. However, doubts have been expressed as to whether online crowdfunding can deliver its promise because of the lack of empirical evidence regarding its effects. In this study, we investigate the effects that prosocial crowdfunding has on traditional microfinance institutions (MFIs). Combining multiple data sources, including data from Kiva.org and the Microfinance Information Exchange Market (MIX Market), we examine how access to crowdfunding influences MFIs’ sustainability and interest rates. We find that after joining Kiva, MFIs’ sustainability improves and interest rates decrease. Further investigation suggests that the changes mainly result from efficiency improvement, rather than increased supply of low-cost funds. We propose that joining an online crowdfunding platform induces greater transparency and crowd monitoring, which motivates and empowers MFIs to improve operations and become more efficient.},

We developed a nomological network linking post-breach compensation strategies to key outcomes, namely continued shopping intentions, positive word-of-mouth, and online complaining, with the effects being mediated by customers’ justice perceptions. We conducted a longitudinal field study investigating Target’s data breach in 2013 that affected more than 110 million customers. We examined customers’ expectations toward compensation immediately after the breach was confirmed (survey 1) and their experiences after reparations were made (survey 2). Evidence from polynomial regression and response surface analyses of data collected from 388 affected customers showed that customers’ justice perceptions were influenced by the actual compensation provided as well as the type and extent of compensation an organization could and should have provided (i.e., customers’ compensation expectations). Interestingly, both positive and negative expectation disconfirmation led to less favorable justice perceptions compared to when expectations were met. Justice perceptions were, in turn, associated with key outcomes. We discuss implications for research on data security, information systems, and justice theory.},

   abstract                      = {Online social cues that utilize user-generated data, such as user reviews and product ratings, have become one of the key factors influencing online user behavior and decisions. Online users who shared their reviews and ratings about a product (or a seller) become an abstract reference group to a focal user interested in the same product. This study focuses on sponsored search results (SSRs), a type of unsolicited information that matches users’ search queries and receives high evaluations from prior consumers. We investigate the effects of positive social cues on alleviating users’ avoidance responses toward an encountered SSR when searching for a product in a C2C e-commerce context. We synthesize the avoidance literature and identify three forms of SSR avoidance, namely, cognitive, behavioral, and affective avoidance. We apply users’ implicit concerns on SSRs to explain users’ avoidance of an encountered SSR. In addition, we extend social influence theory to online settings where abstract reference groups are posited to trigger social influence. We examine how and under what conditions the three forms of SSR avoidance can be reduced by various positive online social cues (i.e., product- and seller-related). We conduct three laboratory experiments. Results attest to users’ implicit concerns on SSRs and their avoidance of SSRs and reveal different effects of various social cues on reducing the three forms of SSR avoidance. This study uncovers the theoretical mechanisms of social influence on reducing SSR avoidance in online settings. It also offers practical implications for online search service providers to help online users’ decision making in their search process.},

   abstract                      = {In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of various recommendation strategies in the mobile channel and their impact on consumers’ utility and demand levels for individual products. We find significant differences in effectiveness among various recommendation strategies. Interestingly, recommendation strategies that directly embed social proofs for the recommended alternatives outperform other recommendations. In addition, recommendation strategies combining social proofs with higher levels of induced awareness due to the prescribed temporal diversity have an even stronger effect on the mobile channel. We also examine the heterogeneity of the demand effect across items, users, and contextual settings, further verifying empirically the aforementioned information and persuasion mechanisms and generating rich insights. We also facilitate the estimation of causal effects in the presence of endogeneity using machine-learning methods. Specifically, we develop novel econometric instruments that capture product differentiation (isolation) based on deeplearning models of user-generated reviews. Our empirical findings extend the current knowledge regarding the heterogeneous impact of recommender systems, reconcile contradictory prior results in the related literature, and have significant business implications.},

   abstract                      = {How and why do societal, organizational and individual factors affecting gender equity in the IT field change over time? To answer this question a longitudinal investigation of the nature of change in factors affecting the position of women in the IT profession was undertaken. It was conducted in Ireland against the backdrop of fluctuations in the nation’s socio-economic status. The individual differences theory of gender and IT was used to analyze life history interviews conducted at four points in time with a total of 63 women whose stories cover the decades from the 1970s to the 2010s. What resulted is a dynamic extension of this theory through the addition of seven themes that characterize the nature of change in factors affecting women IT professionals. The effect on women of economic changes in Ireland is shown to occur through changes in other factors: environmental (i.e., policy, infrastructural, and cultural), identity (e.g., motherhood) and individual (e.g., family). The results reveal both gradual and dramatic changes in an evolving picture of women in this sector, against the back drop of the peaks and valleys of Ireland’s economy. Both transformational and enduring images emerge from this look at Ireland over five decades.},

   abstract                      = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly transforming the way we work, live, and travel. IoT devices collect, store, analyze, and act upon a continuous stream of data as a by-product of everyday use. However, IoT devices need unrestricted data access to fully function. As such, they invade users’ virtual and physical space and raise far-reaching privacy challenges that are unlike those examined in other contexts. As advanced IoT devices, connected cars offer a unique setting to review and extend established theory and evidence on privacy and data sharing. Employing a sequential mixed methods design, we conducted an interview study (n=120), a survey study (n=333), and a field experiment (n=324) among car drivers to develop and validate a contextualized model of individuals’ data sharing decisions. Our findings from the three studies highlight the interplay between virtual and physical risks in shaping drivers’ privacy concerns and data sharing decisions—with information privacy and data security emerging as discrete yet closely interrelated concepts. Our findings also highlight the importance of psychological ownership, conceptualized as drivers’ feelings of possession toward their driving data, as an important addition to established privacy calculus models of data sharing. This novel perspective explains why individuals are reluctant to share even low-sensitivity data that do not raise privacy concerns. The psychological ownership perspective has implications for designing incentives for data-enabled services in ways that augment drivers’ self-efficacy and psychological ownership and thereby encourage them to share driving data. These insights help reconcile a fundamental tension among IoT users—how to avail the benefits of data enabled IoT devices while reducing the psychological costs associated with the sharing of personal data.},

   abstract                      = {Nonmalicious information security policy (ISP) violations can cause organizations significant harm. Here, we aim to extend the understanding of why employees engage in such acts. A large body of ISP violation research is based on the tenet that people violate ISPs to obtain personal benefits, as explained by rational choice and expectancy theories. But this assumption has only been weakly tested, using mostly correlational approaches. Our objective is to improve the causal basis for this argument by using a noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technique, which actually modulates brain activity in regions of the brain that process value/gain assessments. Therefore, it can substantially increase the claim of causality—that expected rewards lead to ISP violations. To do so, we build on expectancy theory and neuroscience knowledge to theorize why reducing the excitability of neurons in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L DLPFC) can lower the endorsement of ISP violations. We test this idea in four experiments in which we use a NIBS technique called high-definition direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). Our findings support the assertion that the L DLPFC is likely involved in the expectancy theory of ISP violations, and that endorsing such violations can be experimentally adjusted with NIBS techniques. These findings extend the understanding of cybersecurity behaviors, improve the causal support for the common assumption made by rational choice theory studies that ISP violations are motivated through perceived benefits, point to the need to consider the L DLPFC in research on positively valenced (or attractive) technology-mediated actions, and pave the way for future use of brain stimulation techniques for stronger causality claims in information systems research.},

Existing studies have focused on a variety of approaches that platforms may use to scale but have not systematically considered that platforms might acquire other companies as part of this growth strategy. In this paper, we study the acquisition patterns of digital platform companies and contrast these with the acquisition patterns of digital non-platform companies. We find that platform companies acquire earlier (shortly after founding) when compared with non-platform companies, and they often first acquire competing platform companies from the same market niche. As platform companies mature, they begin to acquire non-platform companies from other market niches. This contrasts with how acquisitions are made by non-platform companies, as shown in our analysis.},

   abstract                      = {In today’s environment characterized by business dynamism and information technology (IT) advances, firms must frequently update their enterprise information systems (EIS) and their use policies to support changing business operations. In this context, users are challenged to maintain EIS compliance behavior by continuously learning new ways of using EIS. Furthermore, it is imperative to businesses that employees of a functional unit maintain EIS compliance behavior collectively, due to the interdependent nature of tasks that the unit needs to accomplish through EIS. However, it is particularly challenging to achieve such a collective level of EIS compliance, due to the difficulty that these employees may encounter in quickly learning updated EIS. It is, therefore, vital for firms to establish effective managerial principles to ensure collective EIS compliance of a functional unit in a dynamic environment. To address this challenge, this study develops a research model to explain collective EIS compliance by integrating theoretical lens on social context and performance management context with social capital theory. It proposes that social context, an organizational environment characterized by trust and support, positively affects collective EIS compliance by developing business–IT social capital that enhances mutual learning between business and IT personnel. Furthermore, the performance management context, an organizational environment characterized by discipline and “stretch,” is seen to have a direct and beneficial effect on collective EIS compliance as well as an indirect, moderating effect on the causal chain among social contexts, business–IT social capital, and collective EIS compliance. General empirical support for this research model is provided via a multiple-sourced survey of managers and employees of 159 functional units of 53 firms that use EIS, as well as their corresponding IT unit managers. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Too much of a good thing can be harmful. Choice overload, a compelling paradox in consumer psychology, exemplifies this notion with the idea that offering more product options could impede rather than improve consumer satisfaction, even when consumers are free to ignore any available option. After attracting intense interest in the past decades from multiple disciplines, research on choice overload has produced voluminous yet paradoxical findings that are widely perceived as inconsistent even at the meta-analytic level. This paper launches an interdisciplinary inquiry to resolve the inconsistencies on both the conceptual and empirical fronts. Specifically, we identified a surprising butrobust pattern among the existing empirical evidence for the choiceoverload effect and demonstrated through mathematical analysis and extensive simulation studies that the pattern would only likely emerge from one specific type of latent mechanism underlying the moderated choiceoverload effect. The paper discusses the research and practical implications of our findings—namely, the broad promise of analytical meta-analysis (an emerging area for the use of data analytics) and machine learning to address the widely recognized inconsistencies in social and behavioral sciences, and the unique and salient role of the information systems community in developing this new era of meta-analysis.},

   abstract                      = {The prominence of real-time ridesharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, has dramatically changed the landscape of traditional industries. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the short-term wage elasticity of labor supply in real-time ridesharing markets using data from a major ridesharing platform in China. By exploiting an exogenous shock from uneven driving restrictions as an instrumental variable, we find a negative labor supply elasticity for ridesharing drivers, suggesting that drivers tend to drive less during days with a higher average hourly wage. Specifically, a percent increase in hourly wage will lead to a 0.931 percent decrease in daily working hours. This surprising finding is consistent with the behavioral income-targeting model based on the theory of reference-dependent preferences: Drivers have heuristic daily targets for total earnings and are more motivated to supply labor when they are below their income target than when they are above it. Therefore, they work less on days when earnings per hour are high and quit the market once their income target is reached. In addition, we find that taxi drivers are more rational and have positive labor supply elasticity, which implies that drivers are more rational when they have repeated opportunities for learning. Estimating labor supply elasticity is critical to understanding the economic efficiency of various surge pricing algorithms and driver subsidization programs for ridesharing platforms and policymakers. Our research suggests that a uniform price surging or driver subsidization approach for all ridesharing drivers may not incentivize the labor supply of drivers effectively.},

   abstract                      = {Information systems development (ISD) requires both business domain and technology domain knowledge. How cross-domain knowledge affects ISD outcomes is one of the most fundamental and persistent problems in the IS field. We argue that the effect of cross-domain knowledge depends on its distribution across business and IT units and ISD complexity in terms of level and pattern of design element interdependencies. We systematically investigate the complex effects of cross-domain knowledge on ISD performance by using simulations based on the NK fitness landscapes model. We find that cross-domain knowledge not only increases ISD performance but also reduces its variability. These effects are greater when ISD complexity is greater. Crossdomain knowledge is found to increase the robustness of ISD performance across different patterns of design element interdependencies. Interestingly, ISD performance is higher when cross-domain knowledge is unevenly distributed across business and IS units and when its distribution pattern matches the pattern of the design element interdependencies. These findings suggest that the effect of cross-domain knowledge on ISD performance is not fixed but depends on its structural pattern, the level and pattern of design element interdependencies, and their interactions. This study illuminates how and why challenges in ISD might be structural and how, why, and when cross-domain knowledge might help to overcome these challenges. We develop a theoretical framework and propositions based on our findings.},

   abstract                      = {Product review platforms in online marketplaces differ with respect to the granularity of product quality information they provide. While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as the single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as the multidimensional rating scheme). The multidimensional rating scheme is superior to the single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers’ uncertainty about product quality and value. However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multidimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit sellers or society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determines whether a finer-grained multidimensional rating scheme is superior to a coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumer, seller, and social planner perspectives. The main driver of the results is that more (less) granular and less (more) uncertain information exposes (hides) underlying differentiation, or a lack thereof, between competing products, which, in turn, alters upstream price competition in the presence of heterogeneous consumer preferences. The results demonstrate that focusing on the information transfer aspect of rating schemes provides only a partial understanding of the true impacts of rating schemes.},

   abstract                      = {Despite the importance of information technology (IT) innovation in today’s digitalized world, little research attention has been paid to examining how firms can incentivize IT innovation. To fill this gap, the current study investigates the impact of managerial incentives provided to chief executive officers (CEOs) on IT innovation, measured by the number of IT patents. In particular, we examine the role of risk-taking incentives provided to CEOs, captured by the sensitivity of CEO wealth to stock return volatility (i.e., Vega). Vega can motivate CEOs to engage in risky IT innovation projects by aligning their wealth with firm-specific risk. In so doing, we focus on how CEOs’ IT-related human capital (i.e., IT education and IT experience) moderates the relationship between Vega and IT innovation. Our empirical analyses reveal that a higher Vega encourages CEOs to support more IT innovation; more importantly, the impact of Vega on the amount of IT patents is stronger for firms with CEOs who have higher levels of IT education and IT experience. Our study contributes to research and practice by conceptualizing a CEO’s IT-related human capital and validating its moderating role in the relationship between risk-taking incentives provided to the CEO and the amount of IT innovation.},

   abstract                      = {Online labor platforms (OLPs) can use algorithms along two dimensions: matching and control. While previous research has paid considerable attention to how OLPs optimize matching and accommodate market needs, OLPs can also employ algorithms to monitor and tightly control platform work. In this paper, we examine the nature of platform work on OLPs, and the role of algorithmic management in organizing how such work is conducted. Using a qualitative study of Uber drivers’ perceptions, supplemented by interviews with Uber executives and engineers, we present a grounded theory that captures the algorithmic management of work on OLPs. In the context of both algorithmic matching and algorithmic control, platform workers experience tensions relating to work execution, compensation, and belonging. We show that these tensions trigger market-like and organization-like response behaviors by platform workers. Our research contributes to the emerging literature on OLPs.},

   abstract                      = {Product review platforms in online marketplaces differ with respect to the granularity of product quality information they provide. While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as the single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as the multidimensional rating scheme). The multidimensional rating scheme is superior to the single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers’ uncertainty about product quality and value. However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multidimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit sellers or society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determines whether a finer-grained multidimensional rating scheme is superior to a coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumer, seller, and social planner perspectives. The main driver of the results is that more (less) granular and less (more) uncertain information exposes (hides) underlying differentiation, or a lack thereof, between competing products, which, in turn, alters upstream price competition in the presence of heterogeneous consumer preferences. The results demonstrate that focusing on the information transfer aspect of rating schemes provides only a partial understanding of the true impacts of rating schemes.},

   abstract                      = {With today’s technological advancements, mobile phones and wearable devices have become extensions of an increasingly diffused and smart digital infrastructure. In this paper, we examine mobile health (mHealth) platforms and their health and economic impacts on the outcomes of chronic disease patients. To do so, we partnered with a major mHealth firm that provides one of the largest mobile health app platforms in Asia specializing in diabetes care. We designed and implemented a randomized field experiment based on detailed patient health activities (e.g., steps, exercises, sleep, food intake) and blood glucose values from 1,070 diabetes patients over several months. Our main findings show that the adoption of the mHealth app leads to an improvement in health behavior, which in turn leads to both short term metrics (such as reduction in patients’ blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels) and longer-term metrics (such as hospital visits and medical expenses). Patients who adopted the mHealth app undertook higher levels of exercise, consumed healthier food with lower calories, walked more steps and slept for longer times on a daily basis. They also were more likely to substitute offline visits with telehealth. A comparison of mobile versus PC-enabled versions of the same app demonstrates that the mobile version has a stronger effect than PC version in helping patients make these behavioral modifications with respect to diet, exercise, and lifestyle, which ultimately leads to an improvement in their healthcare outcomes. We also compared outcomes when the platform facilitates personalized health reminders to patients vis-à-vis generic (non-personalized) reminders. Surprisingly, we found that personalized mobile messages with patient-specific guidance can have an inadvertent (smaller) effect on patient app engagement and lifestyle changes, leading to a lower health improvement. However, they are more like to encourage a substitution of offline visits by telehealth. Overall, our findings indicate the massive potential of mHealth technologies and platform design in achieving better healthcare outcomes.},

   abstract                      = {Recent statistics indicate that most organizations prefer to fill IT vacancies by rehiring IT professionals who previously worked in the organization. Less is known about what drives IT professionals to “turnback,” a term we define as returning to employment with a former employer. To explain this important and rarely considered IT job mobility behavior, we build on job embeddedness theory and on the concepts of shocks and job dissatisfaction from, among others, the unfolding model of voluntary turnover to develop the theory of IT professional turnback. We perform fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of data collected from 248 IT professionals to draw conclusions about the intention among IT professionals to return to work for a former employer, and develop a midrange theory. Our results reveal two configurations contributing to high turnback intention and three configurations contributing to low turnback intention. Our model distinguishes between work shocks, personal shocks, and IT work shocks. IT shocks are a new category of shocks specific to the IT profession. We contribute theoretically by theorizing a behavior relevant to IT professionals and explaining attributes driving turnback intention.},

For this reason, an extensive discourse exists about their nature. Increasingly, this discourse has become fraught with controversy. Using Bunge’s (1977, 1979) ontology, I examine the nature of constructs and indicators as they are discussed in the extant literature. I define these concepts precisely, disentangle conceptual from measurement issues, and point to ways that discourse about them could better proceed. I show that unidimensional constructs, multidimensional constructs, dimensions, and indicators are all properties in general of a class of things. I also show that only three types of indicators exist—synonyms of the focal construct and succeeding or preceding properties in a pre-order of properties that includes the focal construct. I examine ontologically the notions of content validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and internal-consistency reliability and show their problematic nature. I introduce two new concepts, scope validity and the level of concomitance of indicators, that have rigorous ontological foundations. Together, they provide an improved foundation for assessing the construct validity of a set of indicators.},

   abstract                      = {The literature on information technology (IT) and government corruption in developing countries indicates contradictory evidence about the realization of anti-corruption effects. So far, there is no theoretical explanation of why the anti-corruption potential of IT demonstrated in some countries is not realized in many other countries. Drawing evidence from a case study of information systems interventions at Ghana customs over 35 years, we investigate how and why IT’s anti-corruption potential may be curtailed in the context of developing countries’ governments and societies. We focus on IT-mediated petty corruption practices of street-level officers, which we consider to be socially embedded and institutionally conditioned phenomena. We find that conditions of possibility for the IT-mediated petty corruption practices are created during the implementation of information systems. The configuration of IT and organizational processes of a government agency are constrained by the broader government administration system and influenced by the vested interests of government officers, politicians, and businesses. Subsequently, the co-optation of IT for petty corruption practices is enabled by networks of relationships and institutions of patronage that extend across government, business, and society. We thus explain the often limited effects of IT on petty corruption as the inability of localized information systems implementations to change modes of government administration that are embedded in the enduring neopatrimonial institutions and politics of many developing countries.},

   abstract                      = {An outcome of the rising popularity of crowdsourcing contest platforms has been an increase in the number of tasks available on a platform at the same time. These concurrent tasks compete for the attention of the same pool of solvers. There is some evidence that an increase in the number of competing tasks can reduce the number of solvers participating in a focal task. However, it is not clear exactly how competing tasks influence the quality of tasks, as represented by the best solutions they receive. Using data collected from a popular crowdsourcing platform, we investigate the effects of competing tasks and uncover important underlying mechanisms governing the relationship between competing tasks and task quality. Through analyses at the task, solver, and submission levels, we establish that competing tasks can influence task quality in two ways. First, the number of solvers in each task decreases when there are more competing tasks, and this reduction negatively impacts task quality. Second, the availability of a greater number of competing tasks leads to solvers participating in more tasks simultaneously. This multitasking in turn allows solvers to learn from other tasks, generate better solutions, and improve task quality. Interestingly, we find that these opposing forces offset each other, and that the overall solution quality of the focal task is not affected, despite the fact that an increase in the number of competing tasks reduces the number of solvers participating it.},

   abstract                      = {Online retailers use product ratings to signal quality and help consumers identify products for purchase. These ratings commonly take the form of either non-personalized, aggregate product ratings (i.e., the average rating a product received from a number of consumers such as “the average rating is 4.5/5 based on 100 reviews”), or personalized predicted preference ratings for a product (i.e., recommender-system-generated predictions for a consumer’s rating of a product such as “we think you’d rate this product 4.5/5”). Ratings in either format can provide decision aid to the consumer, but the two formats convey different types of product quality information and operate with different psychological mechanisms. Prior research has indicated that each recommendation type can significantly affect consumer’s post-experience preference ratings, constituting a judgmental bias, but has not compared the effects of these two common product-rating formats. Using a laboratory experiment, we show that aggregate ratings and personalized recommendations create similar biases on post-experience preference ratings when shown separately. Shown together, there is no cumulative increase in the effect. Instead, personalized recommendations tend to dominate. Our findings can help retailers determine how to use these different types of product ratings to most effectively serve their customers. Additionally, these results help to educate the consumer on how product-rating displays influence their stated preferences.},

   abstract                      = {Screening is considered a necessary mechanism for alleviating information asymmetry but has also raised concerns about increased discrimination in online peer-to-peer market platforms. Paradoxically, providers of goods and services may also voluntarily forgo screening, even though it increases the risks and costs associated with poor matches. We examine who may choose to forgo screening and why, and its impact on their performance outcomes. Our study’s empirical context is the Airbnb platform, wherein the “Instant Book” feature enables hosts to forgo the screening of guests. Utilizing a unique panel dataset of all listings in New York City during August 2015-February 2017, we first explore the antecedents of voluntarily switching to instant booking and then causally identify the impacts of switching. Our study provides evidence of the economic benefits of forgoing screening from increased occupancy even as review ratings decline; these effects are stronger for Black and female hosts. We discuss the strategic and social welfare implications of these findings within the context of current conversations on discrimination and bias in the sharing economy.},

A diagrammatic model is defined as a mapping from a domain to a visual representation in such a way that relevant information is preserved to meet a specific goal. So far, cognitive research on diagram criteria in relation to task performance has been fragmented. The aim of this paper is to (1) consolidate research on the cognitive processing steps involved during understanding and task performance with diagrams, (2) consolidate corresponding criteria for such diagrams to best support cognitive processing, and (3) demonstrate the support effective diagrams provide for performing SAD tasks. Addressing the first aim, we develop a theoretical cognitive framework of task performance with diagrams called CogniDia. It integrates different cognitive theories from research on diagrams in software engineering and information systems. Regarding the second aim, we review the literature to organize criteria for effective cognitive processing of diagrams. We identify research gaps on verbal and task processing. Regarding the third aim, we use the theoretical cognitive framework to investigate how diagrams support the SAD process effectively.},

   abstract                      = {Medication nonadherence (MNA) causes severe health ramifications and costs the U.S. healthcare systems $290 billion annually. Understanding patients’ MNA reasons is an urgent goal for researchers, practitioners, and the pharmaceutical industry to mitigate those health and economic consequences. Past years have witnessed soaring patient engagement in social media, making it a cost-efficient and rich information source that can complement prior survey studies and deepen the understanding of MNA. Yet, such a dataset is untapped in existing MNA studies due to technical challenges such as negative decision-making in long texts, varied patient vocabulary, and sparse relevant information. In this work, we develop Sentiment-Enriched DEep Learning (SEDEL) to address these challenges and extract MNA reasons. We evaluate SEDEL on 53,180 reviews of about 180 drugs and achieve a precision of 89.25%, a recall of 88.48%, and an F1 score of 88.86%. SEDEL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models. Nine categories of MNA reasons are identified and verified by domain experts. This study contributes to IS research in two aspects. First, we devise a novel deep-learning-based approach for reason mining. Second, our results provide direct implications for the health industry and practitioners to design interventions.},

   abstract                      = {Under increasing pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility, organizations realize that they cannot claim to be environmentally sustainable if their supply chains are not. This research seeks to understand how an interorganizational green IS influences environmental sustainability (ES) initiatives within organizations in a supply chain. We examine a green IS taking the form of an interorganizational ES platform. Our analysis gives insight into how role conflicts arising from the various roles played by the platform users compromise the nature of actions associated with platform beliefs. In particular, cooptition conflict arising from participants’ roles as supplier to the platform owner and competitor to other platform participants explains the symbolic organizational content contribution, whereas the professional conflict resulting from participants’ roles as employee of an organization and knowledge peer to participants from other organizations explains the substantive personal content contribution. The lack of organizational substantive content creates content paucity, which platform users respond to by developing off-platform relationships with content contributors. The personal ES knowledge acquired through platform content consumption and the relationships with content contributors help individuals advocate for ES initiatives within their organizations. Our research is among the first to consider green IS at an interorganizational level and the corresponding multilevel perspective of the green IS users as they are at once organizational and individual actors.},

   abstract                      = {The growth of mobile devices coupled with advances in mobile technologies has resulted in the development and widespread use of a variety of mobile applications (apps). Mobile apps have been developed for social networking, banking, receiving daily news, maintaining fitness, and job-related tasks. The security of apps is an important concern. However, in some cases, app developers may be less interested in investing in the security of apps, if users are unwilling to pay for the added security. In this paper, we empirically examine whether consumers are less willing to pay for security features than for usability features. In addition, we examine whether a third-party certification of security features makes customers more willing to pay for security. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of risk perceptions on the willingness to pay for security. To explore these issues, we conducted a scenario-based experiment on mobile app users. Results from our analyses show that consumers are indeed less likely to pay for security features than usability features. However, the likelihood of paying for security features can be significantly increased by third-party certification of the features. Based on our analysis, we offer insights to producers of mobile apps to monetize the enhanced security features of their apps.},

   abstract                      = {Through the lens of social movement theory, this paper investigates the drivers of individual users’ social influence on Twitter during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Following this lens, we suggest an extended model of sustained social influence (that considers retweets as the measure of user influence) as a function of the duality of individual Twitter users’ social actions and the underlying facilitating Twitter network structure. Based on an analysis of organic large-scale Twitter data on this social movement, we examine how characteristics of individuals’ social actions, namely activity and tenure on Twitter, and characteristics facilitated by the network (i.e., the number of followers as well as centrality in the community structure of Twitter), impact retweet influence in time windows spanning the movement. Utilizing a mixed methods approach consisting of machine learning and human coding we conceptualize social movement-related engagement activities of Twitter users, which map to generic frames of social movement mobilization. The analysis reveals interesting patterns across different contexts of the Egyptian Revolution. Regarding individual social action, social movement related to “who” and “where” activities, as well as tenure, were found to contribute to individual social influence. In terms of the facilitating structure, the follower network (an observed network structure) and centrality (an unobserved network structure) were both found to contribute significantly to sustained influence.},

Prior investigations on the adoptions of agile paradigms for software operations and their performance implications have typically focused on isolated aspects of software development processes. In this study, we adopt a configurational perspective of software operations and assess the causal impacts of adopting an organizational policy that grants higher levels of autonomy to project teams. Building on the equifinality framework proposed in organizational studies, we posit that an organizational policy that provides higher levels of autonomy for software teams engenders performance-enhancing adaptations through agile reconfigurations of project operations. To test our hypothesis, we collaborated with a commercial software firm and collected data from a policy experiment at the firm. We examined project-level data spanning a four-year observation period during which the firm implemented a new policy that significantly reduced the hurdles for project teams to autonomously reconfigure their operations. The results support our postulation and shed light on how an organizational policy that provides greater autonomy to software},

While most existing methods for financial risk prediction are based on a single information source, which may not adequately capture various complex factors that jointly influence financial risks, we propose a hybrid-strategy-based self-adaptive method to effectively leverage heterogeneous soft information drawn from a variety of sources. The method uses a proposed new feature- sparsity learning method to adaptively integrate multisource heterogeneous soft features with hard features and a proposed improved evidential reasoning rule to adaptively aggregate base classifier predictions, thereby alleviating both the declarative bias and the procedural bias of the learning process. Evaluation in two cases at the individual level (concerning borrowers at a P2P lending platform) and the company level (concerning listed companies in the Chinese stock market) showed that, compared with relying solely on hard features, effectively incorporating multisource heterogeneous soft features using our proposed method enabled earlier prediction of financial risks with desirable performance.},

   abstract                      = {A common problem in many mature markets is how to deal with congestion—a situation in which transaction requests from market participants cannot be accommodated in an expedited manner. This paper examines the congestion problem in sequential Dutch auction markets. Transactions in these markets typically involve perishable goods, making market clearing speed crucial. Traditionally, sequential Dutch auctions have been implemented with fast-paced auction clocks that process equally attractive bids in the order they arrive and only award the first bidder as the winner of each round, which can lead to serious congestion in case of a demand surge. We propose a hybrid mechanism that capitalizes on the discrete nature of the auction clock and batches together the highest bids, allowing multiple transactions at the same price in each round. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid mechanism, we first develop a game-theoretic model comparing the hybrid mechanism to the traditional sequential Dutch auction mechanism. Our model predicts that the hybrid mechanism will achieve higher operational efficiency without compromising allocative efficiency. We then complement the theoretical analysis by evaluating the hybrid mechanism through a quasi-natural field experiment. The empirical analysis of the field data shows that the hybrid mechanism can significantly speed up the market clearing process and increase price stability without affecting the expected revenue. Our findings shed new light on the design and operation of multi-unit auctions.},

Although reciprocity is a fundamental aspect of human psychology, its application in promoting healthy behavior has been limited. We conduct a randomized field experiment with over 1,700 pairs of users on a mobile social network platform. Individuals in the reciprocity treatment group receive a gift from their friends and are asked to return this favor by participating in a running challenge. Their performance is compared to the self-interest incentives widely used in practice. Building on social exchange theory, we argue that reciprocity-based incentives will outperform self-interest incentives with modest reward for motivating behavior change. We find that, on average, reciprocity is stronger than self-interest in inducing exercise behavior by a substantial amount. Furthermore, our results reveal that the magnitude of the reciprocity effect is contingent on the social closeness between senders and receivers. Interestingly, social closeness has an inverted U-shaped influence on the reciprocity effect. The effect is strongest when closeness is moderate, and wanes when closeness is either too strong or too weak. Compared to commonly used self-interest based financial incentives, our findings offer a potentially more powerful avenue for mechanism design in promoting healthy behavior.},

This is alarming at a time when the workforce is rapidly aging and organizational technologies are proliferating. Since the explanation for these lower performance levels remains unclear, managers are not sure how to help older users realize their full potential as contributors to organizational success. The research model presented here identifies the declining information-processing speed of older workers as the cause of their reduced capacity to perform IT-enabled tasks. According to the model, IT experience and IT self-efficacy reduce the negative impacts of this decline, whereas IT overload and the effort cost of IT use aggravate them. To test the model, data were collected using three complementary studies. The results supported the model and indicated five ways that organizations can help older users improve their capacity to perform IT-enabled tasks. Additional data collected in interviews with human resources directors confirmed the relevance of these solutions.},

   abstract                      = {Privacy needs on today’s internet differ from the information privacy needs in traditional e-commerce settings due to their focus on interactions among online peers rather than merely transactions with an online vendor. Peer-oriented online interactions have critical implications for an individual’s virtual presence and self-cognition. Yet existing conceptualizations of internet privacy concerns have solely focused on the control of personal information release and on online interactions with online vendors. Drawing on the theory of personal boundaries, this study revisits the theoretical foundation of online privacy and proposes a multidimensional peer-related privacy concern construct, that focuses on privacy violations from online peers. We term this new construct “Peer Privacy Concern” (PrPC) and define it as the general feeling of being unable to maintain functional personal boundaries in online activities as a result of the behavior of online peers. This construct consists of four dimensions comprised of a reconceptualization of information privacy concerns to also reflect privacy concerns with respect to peers’ handling of self-shared information and with respect to peer-shared information about one’s self, and three new dimensions that tap into the arising privacy needs from virtual interactions (i.e., virtual territory privacy concern and communication privacy concern) as well as from the need to maintain psychological independence (i.e., psychological privacy concern). These new dimensions, which are rooted in the theory of personal boundaries, are prominent privacy needs in online social interactions with peers. However, they are absent from previous privacy concern conceptualizations. Scales for measuring this new construct are developed and empirically validated.},

   abstract                      = {Medication nonadherence (MNA) causes severe health ramifications and costs the U.S. healthcare systems $290 billion annually. Understanding patients’ MNA reasons is an urgent goal for researchers, practitioners, and the pharmaceutical industry to mitigate those health and economic consequences. Past years have witnessed soaring patient engagement in social media, making it a cost-efficient and rich information source that can complement prior survey studies and deepen the understanding of MNA. Yet, such a dataset is untapped in existing MNA studies due to technical challenges such as negative decision-making in long texts, varied patient vocabulary, and sparse relevant information. In this work, we develop Sentiment-Enriched DEep Learning (SEDEL) to address these challenges and extract MNA reasons. We evaluate SEDEL on 53,180 reviews of about 180 drugs and achieve a precision of 89.25%, a recall of 88.48%, and an F1 score of 88.86%. SEDEL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models. Nine categories of MNA reasons are identified and verified by domain experts. This study contributes to IS research in two aspects. First, we devise a novel deep-learning-based approach for reason mining. Second, our results provide direct implications for the health industry and practitioners to design interventions.},

   abstract                      = {Online retailers use product ratings to signal quality and help consumers identify products for purchase. These ratings commonly take the form of either non-personalized, aggregate product ratings (i.e., the average rating a product received from a number of consumers such as “the average rating is 4.5/5 based on 100 reviews”), or personalized predicted preference ratings for a product (i.e., recommender-system-generated predictions for a consumer’s rating of a product such as “we think you’d rate this product 4.5/5”). Ratings in either format can provide decision aid to the consumer, but the two formats convey different types of product quality information and operate with different psychological mechanisms. Prior research has indicated that each recommendation type can significantly affect consumer’s post-experience preference ratings, constituting a judgmental bias, but has not compared the effects of these two common product-rating formats. Using a laboratory experiment, we show that aggregate ratings and personalized recommendations create similar biases on post-experience preference ratings when shown separately. Shown together, there is no cumulative increase in the effect. Instead, personalized recommendations tend to dominate. Our findings can help retailers determine how to use these different types of product ratings to most effectively serve their customers. Additionally, these results help to educate the consumer on how product-rating displays influence their stated preferences.},

   abstract                      = {The success of platform companies often depends on their ability to “scale” their customer and supplier base. Existing studies have focused on a variety of approaches that platforms may use to scale but have not systematically considered that platforms might acquire other companies as part of this growth strategy. In this paper, we study the acquisition patterns of digital platform companies and contrast these with the acquisition patterns of digital non-platform companies. We find that platform companies acquire earlier (shortly after founding) when compared with non-platform companies, and they often first acquire competing platform companies from the same market niche. As platform companies mature, they begin to acquire non-platform companies from other market niches. This contrasts with how acquisitions are made by non-platform companies, as shown in our analysis.},

   abstract                      = {A common problem in many mature markets is how to deal with congestion—a situation in which transaction requests from market participants cannot be accommodated in an expedited manner. This paper examines the congestion problem in sequential Dutch auction markets. Transactions in these markets typically involve perishable goods, making market clearing speed crucial. Traditionally, sequential Dutch auctions have been implemented with fast-paced auction clocks that process equally attractive bids in the order they arrive and only award the first bidder as the winner of each round, which can lead to serious congestion in case of a demand surge. We propose a hybrid mechanism that capitalizes on the discrete nature of the auction clock and batches together the highest bids, allowing multiple transactions at the same price in each round. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid mechanism, we first develop a game-theoretic model comparing the hybrid mechanism to the traditional sequential Dutch auction mechanism. Our model predicts that the hybrid mechanism will achieve higher operational efficiency without compromising allocative efficiency. We then complement the theoretical analysis by evaluating the hybrid mechanism through a quasi-natural field experiment. The empirical analysis of the field data shows that the hybrid mechanism can significantly speed up the market clearing process and increase price stability without affecting the expected revenue. Our findings shed new light on the design and operation of multi-unit auctions.},

However, as overall individual accuracy of the group of humans improves, the individual unique human knowledge decreases. Based on this finding, we claim that humans interacting with AI behave like “Borgs,” that is, cyborg creatures with strong individual performance but no human individuality. We argue that the loss of unique human knowledge may lead to several undesirable outcomes in a host of human–AI decision environments. We demonstrate this harmful impact on the “wisdom of crowds.” Simulation results based on our experimental data suggest that groups of humans interacting with AI are far less effective as compared to human groups without AI assistance. We suggest mitigation techniques to create environments that can provide the best of both worlds (e.g., by personalizing AI advice). We show that such interventions perform well individually as well as in wisdom of crowds settings.},

   abstract                      = {We review the literature on how organizations learn from information system (IS) incidents. We identify three modes of learning depending on the practices that constitute the learning process, the specific actors who play roles in learning, the temporal orientation of the learning practices, and the specific contextual focus of the learning. The literature focuses primarily on learning from past experience to draw lessons for future incidents (reflective learning mode). Yet, a growing stream of literature stresses the importance of learning through engagement with present incidents (embedded learning mode), and a few studies suggest that organizations can learn prospectively to prepare for future incidents (prospective learning mode). We argue that although these three learning modes are effective, they do not adequately explain how organizations learn from IS incidents when used in isolation. Since IS incidents unfold increasingly as sets of interacting events across information systems and organizational settings, organizational learning needs to be theorized as an iterative process among these learning modes. We synthesize these three learning modes into an integrative framework and theorize about their supportive and inhibiting relations. We suggest some opportunities for future research, which would advance our understanding of how organizations learn from IS incidents.},

   abstract                      = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly transforming the way we work, live, and travel. IoT devices collect, store, analyze, and act upon a continuous stream of data as a by-product of everyday use. However, IoT devices need unrestricted data access to fully function. As such, they invade users’ virtual and physical space and raise far-reaching privacy challenges that are unlike those examined in other contexts. As advanced IoT devices, connected cars offer a unique setting to review and extend established theory and evidence on privacy and data sharing. Employing a sequential mixed methods design, we conducted an interview study (n=120), a survey study (n=333), and a field experiment (n=324) among car drivers to develop and validate a contextualized model of individuals’ data sharing decisions. Our findings from the three studies highlight the interplay between virtual and physical risks in shaping drivers’ privacy concerns and data sharing decisions—with information privacy and data security emerging as discrete yet closely interrelated concepts. Our findings also highlight the importance of psychological ownership, conceptualized as drivers’ feelings of possession toward their driving data, as an important addition to established privacy calculus models of data sharing. This novel perspective explains why individuals are reluctant to share even low-sensitivity data that do not raise privacy concerns. The psychological ownership perspective has implications for designing incentives for data-enabled services in ways that augment drivers’ self-efficacy and psychological ownership and thereby encourage them to share driving data. These insights help reconcile a fundamental tension among IoT users—how to avail the benefits of data enabled IoT devices while reducing the psychological costs associated with the sharing of personal data.},

   abstract                      = {In today’s environment characterized by business dynamism and information technology (IT) advances, firms must frequently update their enterprise information systems (EIS) and their use policies to support changing business operations. In this context, users are challenged to maintain EIS compliance behavior by continuously learning new ways of using EIS. Furthermore, it is imperative to businesses that employees of a functional unit maintain EIS compliance behavior collectively, due to the interdependent nature of tasks that the unit needs to accomplish through EIS. However, it is particularly challenging to achieve such a collective level of EIS compliance, due to the difficulty that these employees may encounter in quickly learning updated EIS. It is, therefore, vital for firms to establish effective managerial principles to ensure collective EIS compliance of a functional unit in a dynamic environment. To address this challenge, this study develops a research model to explain collective EIS compliance by integrating theoretical lens on social context and performance management context with social capital theory. It proposes that social context, an organizational environment characterized by trust and support, positively affects collective EIS compliance by developing business–IT social capital that enhances mutual learning between business and IT personnel. Furthermore, the performance management context, an organizational environment characterized by discipline and “stretch,” is seen to have a direct and beneficial effect on collective EIS compliance as well as an indirect, moderating effect on the causal chain among social contexts, business–IT social capital, and collective EIS compliance. General empirical support for this research model is provided via a multiple-sourced survey of managers and employees of 159 functional units of 53 firms that use EIS, as well as their corresponding IT unit managers. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Agile software development, a paradigm that emphasizes project team autonomy and the value of responding to changes over following standardized processes, has gained prominence in the software industry. Prior investigations on the adoptions of agile paradigms for software operations and their performance implications have typically focused on isolated aspects of software development processes. In this study, we adopt a configurational perspective of software operations and assess the causal impacts of adopting an organizational policy that grants higher levels of autonomy to project teams. Building on the equifinality framework proposed in organizational studies, we posit that an organizational policy that provides higher levels of autonomy for software teams engenders performance-enhancing adaptations through agile reconfigurations of project operations. To test our hypothesis, we collaborated with a commercial software firm and collected data from a policy experiment at the firm. We examined project-level data spanning a four-year observation period during which the firm implemented a new policy that significantly reduced the hurdles for project teams to autonomously reconfigure their operations. The results support our postulation and shed light on how an organizational policy that provides greater autonomy to software},

   abstract                      = {Online labor platforms (OLPs) can use algorithms along two dimensions: matching and control. While previous research has paid considerable attention to how OLPs optimize matching and accommodate market needs, OLPs can also employ algorithms to monitor and tightly control platform work. In this paper, we examine the nature of platform work on OLPs, and the role of algorithmic management in organizing how such work is conducted. Using a qualitative study of Uber drivers’ perceptions, supplemented by interviews with Uber executives and engineers, we present a grounded theory that captures the algorithmic management of work on OLPs. In the context of both algorithmic matching and algorithmic control, platform workers experience tensions relating to work execution, compensation, and belonging. We show that these tensions trigger market-like and organization-like response behaviors by platform workers. Our research contributes to the emerging literature on OLPs.},

   abstract                      = {We have recently witnessed two important trends in online retailing: The advent of new media (e.g., social media and search engines) has made advertising affordable for small sellers, and large online retailers (e.g., Amazon and JD.com) have opened their platforms to allow even direct competitors to sell on their platforms. We examine how new-media advertising affects retail platform openness. We develop a game-theoretic model in which a leading retailer, who has both valuation and awareness advantages, and a third-party seller, who sells an identical product, engage in price competition. We find that the availability of relatively low-cost advertising through new media plays a critical role in influencing the leading retailer to open its platform and to form a partnership with the third-party seller, which is impossible when the cost of advertising is relatively high. Low-cost advertising can increase consumer surplus either directly via the third-party seller’s advertising or indirectly via the partnership on the leading retailer’s platform. We also find that the leading retailer has a greater incentive to open its platform and that the partnership is more likely to be formed when there are network effects, when the leading retailer can control the third-party seller’s exposure on its platform, or when the leading retailer can offer a direct advertising service to the third-party seller. Meanwhile, the constraint on the third-party seller’s advertising budget can reduce the leading retailer’s incentive to open its platform, making a partnership less likely. Our analysis offers important insights into the underlying economic incentives that help explain the emerging open retail platform trend in the era of new-media advertising.},

   abstract                      = {We study the effect of peer influence on products that exhibit positive network externalities to non-adopters, i.e., products that benefit adopters’ friends even if they do not adopt. In contrast to products that exhibit positive network externalities upon adoption, this structure of incentives likely results in negative peer influence: the more friends that adopt the product, the smaller the incentive to adopt. We measure this effect empirically by using observational data from a large mobile carrier serving 5.7 million users. We estimate the effect of peer influence across five different products of this type. A naive approach to do this results in a positive estimate for peer influence due to unobserved homophily. We follow two approaches to address this issue. First, we suggest using the number of friends that end up adopting a product as a proxy for unobserved user-fixed effects. Second, we control for homophily by applying a shuffle test, i.e., we compare the effect of peer influence from the original data with the effect obtained from comparable randomly generated data without peer influence. We obtain negative estimates from both approaches, which adds robustness to our findings. Finally, we show that even for these products, the effect of peer influence associated with the first friends that adopt the product is positive because they still convey useful information that reduces uncertainty. The negative effect of peer influence arises only for subsequent friends that adopt the product. While these friends are unlikely to convey new information about the product, they decrease the economic incentive to adopt, resulting in a negative aggregate effect of peer influence.},

This is alarming at a time when the workforce is rapidly aging and organizational technologies are proliferating. Since the explanation for these lower performance levels remains unclear, managers are not sure how to help older users realize their full potential as contributors to organizational success. The research model presented here identifies the declining information-processing speed of older workers as the cause of their reduced capacity to perform IT-enabled tasks. According to the model, IT experience and IT self-efficacy reduce the negative impacts of this decline, whereas IT overload and the effort cost of IT use aggravate them. To test the model, data were collected using three complementary studies. The results supported the model and indicated five ways that organizations can help older users improve their capacity to perform IT-enabled tasks. Additional data collected in interviews with human resources directors confirmed the relevance of these solutions.},

We find significant differences in effectiveness among various recommendation strategies. Interestingly, recommendation strategies that directly embed social proofs for the recommended alternatives outperform other recommendations. In addition, recommendation strategies combining social proofs with higher levels of induced awareness due to the prescribed temporal diversity have an even stronger effect on the mobile channel. We also examine the heterogeneity of the demand effect across items, users, and contextual settings, further verifying empirically the aforementioned information and persuasion mechanisms and generating rich insights. We also facilitate the estimation of causal effects in the presence of endogeneity using machine-learning methods. Specifically, we develop novel econometric instruments that capture product differentiation (isolation) based on deeplearning models of user-generated reviews. Our empirical findings extend the current knowledge regarding the heterogeneous impact of recommender systems, reconcile contradictory prior results in the related literature, and have significant business implications.},

   abstract                      = {Nonmalicious information security policy (ISP) violations can cause organizations significant harm. Here, we aim to extend the understanding of why employees engage in such acts. A large body of ISP violation research is based on the tenet that people violate ISPs to obtain personal benefits, as explained by rational choice and expectancy theories. But this assumption has only been weakly tested, using mostly correlational approaches. Our objective is to improve the causal basis for this argument by using a noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technique, which actually modulates brain activity in regions of the brain that process value/gain assessments. Therefore, it can substantially increase the claim of causality—that expected rewards lead to ISP violations. To do so, we build on expectancy theory and neuroscience knowledge to theorize why reducing the excitability of neurons in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L DLPFC) can lower the endorsement of ISP violations. We test this idea in four experiments in which we use a NIBS technique called high-definition direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). Our findings support the assertion that the L DLPFC is likely involved in the expectancy theory of ISP violations, and that endorsing such violations can be experimentally adjusted with NIBS techniques. These findings extend the understanding of cybersecurity behaviors, improve the causal support for the common assumption made by rational choice theory studies that ISP violations are motivated through perceived benefits, point to the need to consider the L DLPFC in research on positively valenced (or attractive) technology-mediated actions, and pave the way for future use of brain stimulation techniques for stronger causality claims in information systems research.},

   abstract                      = {Online crowdfunding holds the promise of empowering entrepreneurs and small businesses as an innovative alternative financing channel. However, doubts have been expressed as to whether online crowdfunding can deliver its promise because of the lack of empirical evidence regarding its effects. In this study, we investigate the effects that prosocial crowdfunding has on traditional microfinance institutions (MFIs). Combining multiple data sources, including data from Kiva.org and the Microfinance Information Exchange Market (MIX Market), we examine how access to crowdfunding influences MFIs’ sustainability and interest rates. We find that after joining Kiva, MFIs’ sustainability improves and interest rates decrease. Further investigation suggests that the changes mainly result from efficiency improvement, rather than increased supply of low-cost funds. We propose that joining an online crowdfunding platform induces greater transparency and crowd monitoring, which motivates and empowers MFIs to improve operations and become more efficient.},

   abstract                      = {How and why do societal, organizational and individual factors affecting gender equity in the IT field change over time? To answer this question a longitudinal investigation of the nature of change in factors affecting the position of women in the IT profession was undertaken. It was conducted in Ireland against the backdrop of fluctuations in the nation’s socio-economic status. The individual differences theory of gender and IT was used to analyze life history interviews conducted at four points in time with a total of 63 women whose stories cover the decades from the 1970s to the 2010s. What resulted is a dynamic extension of this theory through the addition of seven themes that characterize the nature of change in factors affecting women IT professionals. The effect on women of economic changes in Ireland is shown to occur through changes in other factors: environmental (i.e., policy, infrastructural, and cultural), identity (e.g., motherhood) and individual (e.g., family). The results reveal both gradual and dramatic changes in an evolving picture of women in this sector, against the back drop of the peaks and valleys of Ireland’s economy. Both transformational and enduring images emerge from this look at Ireland over five decades.},

   abstract                      = {Emerging phenomena of ubiquitous multisource data offer promising avenues for making breakthroughs in financial risk prediction. While most existing methods for financial risk prediction are based on a single information source, which may not adequately capture various complex factors that jointly influence financial risks, we propose a hybrid-strategy-based self-adaptive method to effectively leverage heterogeneous soft information drawn from a variety of sources. The method uses a proposed new feature- sparsity learning method to adaptively integrate multisource heterogeneous soft features with hard features and a proposed improved evidential reasoning rule to adaptively aggregate base classifier predictions, thereby alleviating both the declarative bias and the procedural bias of the learning process. Evaluation in two cases at the individual level (concerning borrowers at a P2P lending platform) and the company level (concerning listed companies in the Chinese stock market) showed that, compared with relying solely on hard features, effectively incorporating multisource heterogeneous soft features using our proposed method enabled earlier prediction of financial risks with desirable performance.},

   abstract                      = {Privacy needs on today’s internet differ from the information privacy needs in traditional e-commerce settings due to their focus on interactions among online peers rather than merely transactions with an online vendor. Peer-oriented online interactions have critical implications for an individual’s virtual presence and self-cognition. Yet existing conceptualizations of internet privacy concerns have solely focused on the control of personal information release and on online interactions with online vendors. Drawing on the theory of personal boundaries, this study revisits the theoretical foundation of online privacy and proposes a multidimensional peer-related privacy concern construct, that focuses on privacy violations from online peers. We term this new construct “Peer Privacy Concern” (PrPC) and define it as the general feeling of being unable to maintain functional personal boundaries in online activities as a result of the behavior of online peers. This construct consists of four dimensions comprised of a reconceptualization of information privacy concerns to also reflect privacy concerns with respect to peers’ handling of self-shared information and with respect to peer-shared information about one’s self, and three new dimensions that tap into the arising privacy needs from virtual interactions (i.e., virtual territory privacy concern and communication privacy concern) as well as from the need to maintain psychological independence (i.e., psychological privacy concern). These new dimensions, which are rooted in the theory of personal boundaries, are prominent privacy needs in online social interactions with peers. However, they are absent from previous privacy concern conceptualizations. Scales for measuring this new construct are developed and empirically validated.},

Yet despite the importance of knowing what it takes to use information systems effectively, little theory on the topic exists. One recent and largely untested exception is the theory of effective use (TEU). We report on a contextualization, extension, and test of TEU in the business intelligence (BI) context, a context of considerable importance in which researchers have called for such studies. We used a mixed methods, three-phase approach involving instrument development (n = 218), a two-wave cross-sectional survey (n = 437), and three sets of follow-up interviews (n = 33). The paper contributes by (1) showing how TEU can be contextualized, operationalized, and extended, (2) demonstrating that many of TEU’s predictions hold in the BI context while also revealing ways to improve the theory, and (3) offering practical insights that executives can draw on to improve the use of BI in their organizations.},

   abstract                      = {Despite the importance of information technology (IT) innovation in today’s digitalized world, little research attention has been paid to examining how firms can incentivize IT innovation. To fill this gap, the current study investigates the impact of managerial incentives provided to chief executive officers (CEOs) on IT innovation, measured by the number of IT patents. In particular, we examine the role of risk-taking incentives provided to CEOs, captured by the sensitivity of CEO wealth to stock return volatility (i.e., Vega). Vega can motivate CEOs to engage in risky IT innovation projects by aligning their wealth with firm-specific risk. In so doing, we focus on how CEOs’ IT-related human capital (i.e., IT education and IT experience) moderates the relationship between Vega and IT innovation. Our empirical analyses reveal that a higher Vega encourages CEOs to support more IT innovation; more importantly, the impact of Vega on the amount of IT patents is stronger for firms with CEOs who have higher levels of IT education and IT experience. Our study contributes to research and practice by conceptualizing a CEO’s IT-related human capital and validating its moderating role in the relationship between risk-taking incentives provided to the CEO and the amount of IT innovation.},

   abstract                      = {Despite increased empirical attention, theory on bots and how they act to disseminate information on social media remains poorly understood. Our study leverages the conduit brokerage perspective and the findings of a multiple case study to develop a novel framework of algorithmic conduit brokerage for understanding information dissemination by bots and the design choices that may influence their actions. Algorithmic conduit brokerage encompasses two intertwined processes. The first process, algorithmic social alertness, relies on bot activity to curate and reconfigure information. Algorithmic social alertness is significant because it involves action triggers that dictate the kinds of information being searched, discovered, and retrieved by bots. The second process, algorithmic social transmission, relies on bot activity to embellish and distribute the information curated. Algorithmic social transmission is important because it can broaden the reach of information disseminated by bots through increased discoverability and directed targeting. The two algorithmic conduit brokerage processes we offer are unique to bots and distinct from the original conceptualization of conduit brokerage, which is rooted in human activity. First, since bots lack the human ability of sensemaking and are instead fueled by automation and action triggers rather than by emotions, algorithmic conduit brokerage is more invariant and reliable than human conduit brokerage. Second, automation increases the speed and scale of information curation and transfer, making algorithmic conduit brokerage not only more consistent but also faster and more extensive. Third, algorithmic conduit brokerage includes a set of new concepts (e.g., action triggers and rapid scaling) that are specific to bots and therefore not applicable to human conduit brokerage.},

   abstract                      = {Online social cues that utilize user-generated data, such as user reviews and product ratings, have become one of the key factors influencing online user behavior and decisions. Online users who shared their reviews and ratings about a product (or a seller) become an abstract reference group to a focal user interested in the same product. This study focuses on sponsored search results (SSRs), a type of unsolicited information that matches users’ search queries and receives high evaluations from prior consumers. We investigate the effects of positive social cues on alleviating users’ avoidance responses toward an encountered SSR when searching for a product in a C2C e-commerce context. We synthesize the avoidance literature and identify three forms of SSR avoidance, namely, cognitive, behavioral, and affective avoidance. We apply users’ implicit concerns on SSRs to explain users’ avoidance of an encountered SSR. In addition, we extend social influence theory to online settings where abstract reference groups are posited to trigger social influence. We examine how and under what conditions the three forms of SSR avoidance can be reduced by various positive online social cues (i.e., product- and seller-related). We conduct three laboratory experiments. Results attest to users’ implicit concerns on SSRs and their avoidance of SSRs and reveal different effects of various social cues on reducing the three forms of SSR avoidance. This study uncovers the theoretical mechanisms of social influence on reducing SSR avoidance in online settings. It also offers practical implications for online search service providers to help online users’ decision making in their search process.},

   abstract                      = {An outcome of the rising popularity of crowdsourcing contest platforms has been an increase in the number of tasks available on a platform at the same time. These concurrent tasks compete for the attention of the same pool of solvers. There is some evidence that an increase in the number of competing tasks can reduce the number of solvers participating in a focal task. However, it is not clear exactly how competing tasks influence the quality of tasks, as represented by the best solutions they receive. Using data collected from a popular crowdsourcing platform, we investigate the effects of competing tasks and uncover important underlying mechanisms governing the relationship between competing tasks and task quality. Through analyses at the task, solver, and submission levels, we establish that competing tasks can influence task quality in two ways. First, the number of solvers in each task decreases when there are more competing tasks, and this reduction negatively impacts task quality. Second, the availability of a greater number of competing tasks leads to solvers participating in more tasks simultaneously. This multitasking in turn allows solvers to learn from other tasks, generate better solutions, and improve task quality. Interestingly, we find that these opposing forces offset each other, and that the overall solution quality of the focal task is not affected, despite the fact that an increase in the number of competing tasks reduces the number of solvers participating it.},

   abstract                      = {Data breaches are a major threat to organizations from both financial and customer relations perspectives. We developed a nomological network linking post-breach compensation strategies to key outcomes, namely continued shopping intentions, positive word-of-mouth, and online complaining, with the effects being mediated by customers’ justice perceptions. We conducted a longitudinal field study investigating Target’s data breach in 2013 that affected more than 110 million customers. We examined customers’ expectations toward compensation immediately after the breach was confirmed (survey 1) and their experiences after reparations were made (survey 2). Evidence from polynomial regression and response surface analyses of data collected from 388 affected customers showed that customers’ justice perceptions were influenced by the actual compensation provided as well as the type and extent of compensation an organization could and should have provided (i.e., customers’ compensation expectations). Interestingly, both positive and negative expectation disconfirmation led to less favorable justice perceptions compared to when expectations were met. Justice perceptions were, in turn, associated with key outcomes. We discuss implications for research on data security, information systems, and justice theory.},

   abstract                      = {Online professional networks are important tools used by recruiters to find qualified candidates for job openings. Within these networks, professional recommendations are used to supplement profiles and add credibility. These recommendations tend to be overly positive, full of superlatives, and lacking in critical statements (referred to as scope of improvement). We draw on the theory of online trust to argue that having scope of improvement and superlatives may affect various dimensions of trust and to show how online trust, in turn, can affect the usefulness of a recommendation and the likelihood of receiving an interview. We contribute to the body of work on online trust both theoretically and empirically. From a theory perspective, we explain why including scope of improvement and superlatives in recommendations on online professional networks may help certain candidates in getting an interview but hurt others. From an empirical perspective, we provide a unique empirical setting that allows us to observe not only the effect of scope of improvement and superlatives, but also validate the theoretically argued underlying process. Furthermore, through discussion with recruiters, we identify then test contextual factors that differentiate recommendations on online professional networks from traditional recommendations. In this study, we use a scenario-based, quasi-experimental survey to test the effects of superlatives and scope of improvement on the usefulness and effectiveness of recommendations. Further, we test the mediating role of trust and how the experience levels of the recommendee affect the sign and strength of these relationships. Our findings indicate that including scope of improvement increases the effectiveness and usefulness of recommendations for candidates at low- and middle levels of experience. For the most experienced candidates, including scope of improvement has a negative effect on effectiveness. Superlatives negatively affect the perceived competence of the recommender and thus should be avoided. This negative effect is reduced when combined with scope of improvement.},

   abstract                      = {The prominence of real-time ridesharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, has dramatically changed the landscape of traditional industries. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the short-term wage elasticity of labor supply in real-time ridesharing markets using data from a major ridesharing platform in China. By exploiting an exogenous shock from uneven driving restrictions as an instrumental variable, we find a negative labor supply elasticity for ridesharing drivers, suggesting that drivers tend to drive less during days with a higher average hourly wage. Specifically, a percent increase in hourly wage will lead to a 0.931 percent decrease in daily working hours. This surprising finding is consistent with the behavioral income-targeting model based on the theory of reference-dependent preferences: Drivers have heuristic daily targets for total earnings and are more motivated to supply labor when they are below their income target than when they are above it. Therefore, they work less on days when earnings per hour are high and quit the market once their income target is reached. In addition, we find that taxi drivers are more rational and have positive labor supply elasticity, which implies that drivers are more rational when they have repeated opportunities for learning. Estimating labor supply elasticity is critical to understanding the economic efficiency of various surge pricing algorithms and driver subsidization programs for ridesharing platforms and policymakers. Our research suggests that a uniform price surging or driver subsidization approach for all ridesharing drivers may not incentivize the labor supply of drivers effectively.},

   abstract                      = {Under increasing pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility, organizations realize that they cannot claim to be environmentally sustainable if their supply chains are not. This research seeks to understand how an interorganizational green IS influences environmental sustainability (ES) initiatives within organizations in a supply chain. We examine a green IS taking the form of an interorganizational ES platform. Our analysis gives insight into how role conflicts arising from the various roles played by the platform users compromise the nature of actions associated with platform beliefs. In particular, cooptition conflict arising from participants’ roles as supplier to the platform owner and competitor to other platform participants explains the symbolic organizational content contribution, whereas the professional conflict resulting from participants’ roles as employee of an organization and knowledge peer to participants from other organizations explains the substantive personal content contribution. The lack of organizational substantive content creates content paucity, which platform users respond to by developing off-platform relationships with content contributors. The personal ES knowledge acquired through platform content consumption and the relationships with content contributors help individuals advocate for ES initiatives within their organizations. Our research is among the first to consider green IS at an interorganizational level and the corresponding multilevel perspective of the green IS users as they are at once organizational and individual actors.},

   abstract                      = {Product review platforms in online marketplaces differ with respect to the granularity of product quality information they provide. While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as the single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as the multidimensional rating scheme). The multidimensional rating scheme is superior to the single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers’ uncertainty about product quality and value. However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multidimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit sellers or society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determines whether a finer-grained multidimensional rating scheme is superior to a coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumer, seller, and social planner perspectives. The main driver of the results is that more (less) granular and less (more) uncertain information exposes (hides) underlying differentiation, or a lack thereof, between competing products, which, in turn, alters upstream price competition in the presence of heterogeneous consumer preferences. The results demonstrate that focusing on the information transfer aspect of rating schemes provides only a partial understanding of the true impacts of rating schemes.},

   abstract                      = {Recent statistics indicate that most organizations prefer to fill IT vacancies by rehiring IT professionals who previously worked in the organization. Less is known about what drives IT professionals to “turnback,” a term we define as returning to employment with a former employer. To explain this important and rarely considered IT job mobility behavior, we build on job embeddedness theory and on the concepts of shocks and job dissatisfaction from, among others, the unfolding model of voluntary turnover to develop the theory of IT professional turnback. We perform fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of data collected from 248 IT professionals to draw conclusions about the intention among IT professionals to return to work for a former employer, and develop a midrange theory. Our results reveal two configurations contributing to high turnback intention and three configurations contributing to low turnback intention. Our model distinguishes between work shocks, personal shocks, and IT work shocks. IT shocks are a new category of shocks specific to the IT profession. We contribute theoretically by theorizing a behavior relevant to IT professionals and explaining attributes driving turnback intention.},

   abstract                      = {With today’s technological advancements, mobile phones and wearable devices have become extensions of an increasingly diffused and smart digital infrastructure. In this paper, we examine mobile health (mHealth) platforms and their health and economic impacts on the outcomes of chronic disease patients. To do so, we partnered with a major mHealth firm that provides one of the largest mobile health app platforms in Asia specializing in diabetes care. We designed and implemented a randomized field experiment based on detailed patient health activities (e.g., steps, exercises, sleep, food intake) and blood glucose values from 1,070 diabetes patients over several months. Our main findings show that the adoption of the mHealth app leads to an improvement in health behavior, which in turn leads to both short term metrics (such as reduction in patients’ blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels) and longer-term metrics (such as hospital visits and medical expenses). Patients who adopted the mHealth app undertook higher levels of exercise, consumed healthier food with lower calories, walked more steps and slept for longer times on a daily basis. They also were more likely to substitute offline visits with telehealth. A comparison of mobile versus PC-enabled versions of the same app demonstrates that the mobile version has a stronger effect than PC version in helping patients make these behavioral modifications with respect to diet, exercise, and lifestyle, which ultimately leads to an improvement in their healthcare outcomes. We also compared outcomes when the platform facilitates personalized health reminders to patients vis-à-vis generic (non-personalized) reminders. Surprisingly, we found that personalized mobile messages with patient-specific guidance can have an inadvertent (smaller) effect on patient app engagement and lifestyle changes, leading to a lower health improvement. However, they are more like to encourage a substitution of offline visits by telehealth. Overall, our findings indicate the massive potential of mHealth technologies and platform design in achieving better healthcare outcomes.},

   abstract                      = {We examine the role of reciprocity enabled by digital social platforms for offline healthy behavior. Although reciprocity is a fundamental aspect of human psychology, its application in promoting healthy behavior has been limited. We conduct a randomized field experiment with over 1,700 pairs of users on a mobile social network platform. Individuals in the reciprocity treatment group receive a gift from their friends and are asked to return this favor by participating in a running challenge. Their performance is compared to the self-interest incentives widely used in practice. Building on social exchange theory, we argue that reciprocity-based incentives will outperform self-interest incentives with modest reward for motivating behavior change. We find that, on average, reciprocity is stronger than self-interest in inducing exercise behavior by a substantial amount. Furthermore, our results reveal that the magnitude of the reciprocity effect is contingent on the social closeness between senders and receivers. Interestingly, social closeness has an inverted U-shaped influence on the reciprocity effect. The effect is strongest when closeness is moderate, and wanes when closeness is either too strong or too weak. Compared to commonly used self-interest based financial incentives, our findings offer a potentially more powerful avenue for mechanism design in promoting healthy behavior.},

   abstract                      = {Technology standardization unfolds as a dialectic process marked by paradoxical tensions. However, standardization research has yet to provide a dialectic analysis of how tensions and management responses interact recursively over time, and with what effect. In this paper, we apply dialectics to analyze an action research study of a Swedish initiative that developed and diffused a technology standard to facilitate the integration of disparate IT systems in road haulage firms. Drawing on the technology standardization literature and our empirical analysis, we engage in midrange theorizing to capture the recursive dynamics through which standard-setters construct and respond to manifestations of three latent tensions: development versus diffusion activities, private versus public interests, and local versus global solutions. Our resulting dialectic theorizing explicates how standard-setters bring these latent tensions into being; how they construct salient tensions through the oppositional logics of polarization, complementarity, and mutuality; how they manage these tensions through splitting, integrating, and suspension responses; and how consequential functional, architectural, and organizational standardization outcomes produce a new social order in which new tensions emerge. These theoretical insights contribute to both the technology standardization and dialectics literatures.},

   abstract                      = {Screening is considered a necessary mechanism for alleviating information asymmetry but has also raised concerns about increased discrimination in online peer-to-peer market platforms. Paradoxically, providers of goods and services may also voluntarily forgo screening, even though it increases the risks and costs associated with poor matches. We examine who may choose to forgo screening and why, and its impact on their performance outcomes. Our study’s empirical context is the Airbnb platform, wherein the “Instant Book” feature enables hosts to forgo the screening of guests. Utilizing a unique panel dataset of all listings in New York City during August 2015-February 2017, we first explore the antecedents of voluntarily switching to instant booking and then causally identify the impacts of switching. Our study provides evidence of the economic benefits of forgoing screening from increased occupancy even as review ratings decline; these effects are stronger for Black and female hosts. We discuss the strategic and social welfare implications of these findings within the context of current conversations on discrimination and bias in the sharing economy.},

   abstract                      = {Too much of a good thing can be harmful. Choice overload, a compelling paradox in consumer psychology, exemplifies this notion with the idea that offering more product options could impede rather than improve consumer satisfaction, even when consumers are free to ignore any available option. After attracting intense interest in the past decades from multiple disciplines, research on choice overload has produced voluminous yet paradoxical findings that are widely perceived as inconsistent even at the meta-analytic level. This paper launches an interdisciplinary inquiry to resolve the inconsistencies on both the conceptual and empirical fronts. Specifically, we identified a surprising butrobust pattern among the existing empirical evidence for the choiceoverload effect and demonstrated through mathematical analysis and extensive simulation studies that the pattern would only likely emerge from one specific type of latent mechanism underlying the moderated choiceoverload effect. The paper discusses the research and practical implications of our findings—namely, the broad promise of analytical meta-analysis (an emerging area for the use of data analytics) and machine learning to address the widely recognized inconsistencies in social and behavioral sciences, and the unique and salient role of the information systems community in developing this new era of meta-analysis.},

   abstract                      = {The literature on information technology (IT) and government corruption in developing countries indicates contradictory evidence about the realization of anti-corruption effects. So far, there is no theoretical explanation of why the anti-corruption potential of IT demonstrated in some countries is not realized in many other countries. Drawing evidence from a case study of information systems interventions at Ghana customs over 35 years, we investigate how and why IT’s anti-corruption potential may be curtailed in the context of developing countries’ governments and societies. We focus on IT-mediated petty corruption practices of street-level officers, which we consider to be socially embedded and institutionally conditioned phenomena. We find that conditions of possibility for the IT-mediated petty corruption practices are created during the implementation of information systems. The configuration of IT and organizational processes of a government agency are constrained by the broader government administration system and influenced by the vested interests of government officers, politicians, and businesses. Subsequently, the co-optation of IT for petty corruption practices is enabled by networks of relationships and institutions of patronage that extend across government, business, and society. We thus explain the often limited effects of IT on petty corruption as the inability of localized information systems implementations to change modes of government administration that are embedded in the enduring neopatrimonial institutions and politics of many developing countries.},

   abstract                      = {The growth of mobile devices coupled with advances in mobile technologies has resulted in the development and widespread use of a variety of mobile applications (apps). Mobile apps have been developed for social networking, banking, receiving daily news, maintaining fitness, and job-related tasks. The security of apps is an important concern. However, in some cases, app developers may be less interested in investing in the security of apps, if users are unwilling to pay for the added security. In this paper, we empirically examine whether consumers are less willing to pay for security features than for usability features. In addition, we examine whether a third-party certification of security features makes customers more willing to pay for security. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of risk perceptions on the willingness to pay for security. To explore these issues, we conducted a scenario-based experiment on mobile app users. Results from our analyses show that consumers are indeed less likely to pay for security features than usability features. However, the likelihood of paying for security features can be significantly increased by third-party certification of the features. Based on our analysis, we offer insights to producers of mobile apps to monetize the enhanced security features of their apps.},

   abstract                      = {Models play an important role in systems analysis and design (SAD). A diagrammatic model is defined as a mapping from a domain to a visual representation in such a way that relevant information is preserved to meet a specific goal. So far, cognitive research on diagram criteria in relation to task performance has been fragmented. The aim of this paper is to (1) consolidate research on the cognitive processing steps involved during understanding and task performance with diagrams, (2) consolidate corresponding criteria for such diagrams to best support cognitive processing, and (3) demonstrate the support effective diagrams provide for performing SAD tasks. Addressing the first aim, we develop a theoretical cognitive framework of task performance with diagrams called CogniDia. It integrates different cognitive theories from research on diagrams in software engineering and information systems. Regarding the second aim, we review the literature to organize criteria for effective cognitive processing of diagrams. We identify research gaps on verbal and task processing. Regarding the third aim, we use the theoretical cognitive framework to investigate how diagrams support the SAD process effectively.},

   abstract                      = {We define a prescriptive analytics framework that addresses the needs of a constrained decision-maker facing, ex ante, unknown costs and benefits of multiple policy levers. The framework is general in nature and can be deployed in any utility-maximizing context, public or private. It relies on randomized field experiments for causal inference, machine learning for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, and on the optimization of an integer linear program for converting predictions into decisions. The net result is the discovery of individual-level targeting of policy interventions to maximize overall utility under a budget constraint. The framework is set in the context of the four pillars of analytics and is especially valuable for companies that already have an existing practice of running A/B tests. The key contribution of this work is to develop and operationalize a framework to exploit both within- and between-treatment arm heterogeneity in the utility response function in order to derive benefits from future (optimized) prescriptions. We demonstrate the value of this framework as compared to benchmark practices—i.e., the use of the average treatment effect, uplift modeling, as well as an extension to contextual bandits—in two different settings. Unlike these standard approaches, our framework is able to recognize, adapt to, and exploit the (potential) presence of different subpopulations that experience varying costs and benefits within a treatment arm while also exhibiting differential costs and benefits across treatment arms. As a result, we find a targeting strategy that produces an order of magnitude improvement in expected total utility for the case where significant within- and between-treatment arm heterogeneity exists.},

   abstract                      = {Information systems development (ISD) requires both business domain and technology domain knowledge. How cross-domain knowledge affects ISD outcomes is one of the most fundamental and persistent problems in the IS field. We argue that the effect of cross-domain knowledge depends on its distribution across business and IT units and ISD complexity in terms of level and pattern of design element interdependencies. We systematically investigate the complex effects of cross-domain knowledge on ISD performance by using simulations based on the NK fitness landscapes model. We find that cross-domain knowledge not only increases ISD performance but also reduces its variability. These effects are greater when ISD complexity is greater. Crossdomain knowledge is found to increase the robustness of ISD performance across different patterns of design element interdependencies. Interestingly, ISD performance is higher when cross-domain knowledge is unevenly distributed across business and IS units and when its distribution pattern matches the pattern of the design element interdependencies. These findings suggest that the effect of cross-domain knowledge on ISD performance is not fixed but depends on its structural pattern, the level and pattern of design element interdependencies, and their interactions. This study illuminates how and why challenges in ISD might be structural and how, why, and when cross-domain knowledge might help to overcome these challenges. We develop a theoretical framework and propositions based on our findings.},

   abstract                      = {Product review platforms in online marketplaces differ with respect to the granularity of product quality information they provide. While some platforms provide a single overall rating for product quality (also referred to as the single-dimensional rating scheme), others provide a separate rating for each individual quality attribute (also referred to as the multidimensional rating scheme). The multidimensional rating scheme is superior to the single-dimensional rating scheme, ceteris paribus, in reducing consumers’ uncertainty about product quality and value. However, we show that, when sellers respond to product ratings by adjusting their prices, compared to the single-dimensional rating scheme, the multidimensional rating scheme does not always benefit consumers, nor does it necessarily benefit sellers or society. The uncertainty associated with quality attribute rating and the extent of differentiation between competing products determines whether a finer-grained multidimensional rating scheme is superior to a coarser-grained single-dimensional rating scheme from the consumer, seller, and social planner perspectives. The main driver of the results is that more (less) granular and less (more) uncertain information exposes (hides) underlying differentiation, or a lack thereof, between competing products, which, in turn, alters upstream price competition in the presence of heterogeneous consumer preferences. The results demonstrate that focusing on the information transfer aspect of rating schemes provides only a partial understanding of the true impacts of rating schemes.},

   abstract                      = {Through the lens of social movement theory, this paper investigates the drivers of individual users’ social influence on Twitter during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Following this lens, we suggest an extended model of sustained social influence (that considers retweets as the measure of user influence) as a function of the duality of individual Twitter users’ social actions and the underlying facilitating Twitter network structure. Based on an analysis of organic large-scale Twitter data on this social movement, we examine how characteristics of individuals’ social actions, namely activity and tenure on Twitter, and characteristics facilitated by the network (i.e., the number of followers as well as centrality in the community structure of Twitter), impact retweet influence in time windows spanning the movement. Utilizing a mixed methods approach consisting of machine learning and human coding we conceptualize social movement-related engagement activities of Twitter users, which map to generic frames of social movement mobilization. The analysis reveals interesting patterns across different contexts of the Egyptian Revolution. Regarding individual social action, social movement related to “who” and “where” activities, as well as tenure, were found to contribute to individual social influence. In terms of the facilitating structure, the follower network (an observed network structure) and centrality (an unobserved network structure) were both found to contribute significantly to sustained influence.},
